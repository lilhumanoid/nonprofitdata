# ðŸ¦Š Fictitious Conservation Nonprofit Dataset

Realistic donor data for learning/practicing data analysis, creating portfolio projects, or anything else you'd like to do with donor data.

Uses Python. Faker, numpy and pandas are required, but as written, the code also imports Seaborn and matplotlib if you want to create some basic visualizations.

## What's included:
- 500+ diverse donors with demographics (i.e., names, addresses, phone numbers, gender, income level, age/generation)
- 2000+ donation transactions
- Realistic patterns and logic (i.e., monthly sustainers actually have monthly donations at different amounts)
- Events, campaigns, and acquisition methods 



(Code by me + Sonnet!)
